# Issue Fixed #1: Backup repositories were backed up onto multiple locations.
https://github.com/phanandco/security-project-code-copy/commit/46206eec15a655dcd5bf83839047703264f3804a
   A fork branch was created to make sure there is a backup version of the original repository. Modifying and changing the duplicated repository will not affect the contain of the original code. You can also create a pull request to see modifications between the duplicated repository and the original repository. It also retains a version of the repository if one of the repositories get loss or accidentally deleted.
# Issue Fixed #2 
https://github.com/phanandco/security-project-code-copy/commit/b50fce2e8eaae9bc06cd281442d4a2e4ddbb18c6
   A new comment was made within the code to ensure the users that have access to the code that they need the lastest version of the SFML library or else it would not work properly. Installing the lastest update ensures the lastest security and bug fixes implementation to improve user experince and fluidity. The users have Clion or Visual Studio installed on their devices previously to the SFML installation.
